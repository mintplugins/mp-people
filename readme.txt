Save person profiles and display them in groups such as "Staff".

== Description ==

This plugin makes it easy it to save and display "Persons" along with info about them, their picture, and social links. You can then display them in groups such as "Staff", or "The Avengers", or "The Justice League" etc.

While this will work with any theme, themes that have built in styles for this plugin will generally look better.
